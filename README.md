Game-terms Description:
⦁	Arc: 
Growth (a future in which progress continues along current trajectories, often marked by technological or economic development)
Discipline (a future where order is deliberately imposed, emphasizing control, regulation, or structured systems)
Transformation (future shaped by deep historical changes, including shifts in values, perceptions, and cultural paradigms):
One decade // Two generations // One century // One millennium 

⦁	Terrain (visual composition): 
Fissure: Compose using cuts, gaps, absences, perforations, or interruptions;
Flow: Use lines/linearity to guide movement, rhythm, repetitions, and gradients;
Accumulation: Create dense layering, overlapping, and repetitions that generate mass or visual noise;
Weave: Compose with interconnected, modular, or grid-like elements or geometries;
Resonance: Create harmony between color, form, and scale—seeking combinations among all three or between any two of these elements;
Rupture: Operate with visual collisions, juxtapositions, or tensions involving proximity, dimensions, or scale;

⦁	Object: "An installation to incorporate ancestral urban culture", "An installation about listening, memory, and repair", "An installation to strengthen coexistence and reciprocity with nature", "An installation dedicated to valuing bodily movement and rituals", "An installation as a space for intergenerational orality", "An installation that addresses climate transition".

⦁	Atmosphere: Hope, Calm, Optimism, Playfulness, Fascination, Well-being.
